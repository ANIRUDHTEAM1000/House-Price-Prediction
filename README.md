# House-Price-Prediction
This will take few parameters based on house as input and predicts price
I used linear regression model to predict house price. 
The linear regression line finds the best fit line of training data. 
It finds best fit line is line where the errors are minimized. 
It uses distance to calculate best fit line. 
And finds the slope. Using this slope it predicts the new inputs result.
